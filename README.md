# TradeNest
 
In everyday life, there are often goods or services that are unused or not fully utilized. Meanwhile, the desire to obtain other goods or services may exist, but traditional exchange processes are less efficient and sometimes difficult to organize. If we don't use an item and want to exchange an item that we want to use, we can barter with someone who needs the item.
